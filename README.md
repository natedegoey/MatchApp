# MatchApp
A much more complex gaming application for iOS. Under the teachings of CodeWithChris, I created this Matching card game. The user has a set amount of time to find all the matches on the screen. This introduced scroll view, card animations for card flipping, sound effects and pop-up messages. A huge leap from the War card game, this project gave me a much better taste of what real iOS development is all about! Thank you CodeWithChris!

Note: Could not upload image assets as there were too many of them.
